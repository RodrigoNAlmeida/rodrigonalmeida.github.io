**Description**
---------------

This reading group is centered on reading the book “Sheaves, Games and Model Completions”. The goal is to understand some of the central techniques exploited by the authors, especially Ghilardi, in proving and reproving some key theorems of non-classical logic: Pitts’ uniform interpolation theorem; the non-uniform interpolation of S4; Ruitenburg’s theorem; the Finitarity of Unification of IPC, S4, and other systems; the structure of algebras of truth-values in Elementary Toposes; amongst others. Since many of these topics are active areas of research, the focus of the reading group will be on topics immediately relevant to the participants’ interests and research specializations. Every two weeks we will meet with a presentation, which will give an overview of the reading material for those two weeks. Reading material will be updated regularly here at the end of each session.

Our first focus will be on getting the basic concepts of the field, before moving on to the key concepts:

1.  **Free, Finitely Generated and Finitely Presented Algebras**
2.  **Congruence Properties, Amalgamation Properties**
3.  **Model Completions**
4.  **R-Regular Categories and R-Heyting Categories**
5.  **Heyting Algebras and the structure of Finitely Presented Heyting Algebras**

### **Meeting Schedule**

We meet bi-weekly. Meetings are in person in SP107.
