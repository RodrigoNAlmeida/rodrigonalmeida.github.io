**Project Description**
-----------------------

Topology is one of the basic areas of contemporary mathematics, and finds applications in all areas of logic: from traditionally mathematical subjects (model theory, set theory, category theory and algebraic logic) to areas of philosophy (epistemic logic, formal epistemology), formal semantics or computation (domain theory, learning theory).<br>

Its key idea is that one can understand space through very simple units - so called “open” and “closed” sets, and their interaction - in a way that can capture both the intuitive properties of physical space, and also more abstract notions of “space”: spaces of ideas, information spaces, or even spaces of actions, for example, in computation.  
In this project we will familiarise students with the basic concepts of topology as they are used in logical practice. This will be done by allowing students to self-study six recordings of 1.5-hour lectures, covering the basic core concepts one tends to encounter in these settings (continuity, neighbourhood filters, compactness, connectedness, separation), and it will include well as forays into more advanced topics and relationships, pursued by students.  
Importantly, we will emphasise how topology appears naturally in many logical contexts, and use them to develop intuition about the crucial concepts of topology.
