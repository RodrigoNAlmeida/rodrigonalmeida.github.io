**Description**
---------------

This reading group, framed as a quest to understand Espindola’s attack on Shelah’s eventual categoricty conjecture, is focused on the study of categorical model theory. The key focus for now will be on the categoricity conjecture. We will begin by exploring this setting in the more or less classical setting of classes of models of model-theoretic logics and abstract elementary classes, to understand the nature of the conjecture, before moving on to the category theoretic generalizations. Our goal will be to get a solid grounding in the kinds of tools that are used to work in this area: categorical logic; topos-theoretic completeness; infinitary completeness theorems; amongst others.

Importantly, we are not sure we will complete our quest, and that is not really the point.

Our preliminary topic schedule will be as follows:

1.  **Stability Theory, Categoricity and Abstract Elementary Classes**
2.  **Accessible Categories and Model Theory**
3.  **Categorical Logic**
4.  **Topos Theoretic Completeness**

Please contact us for access to the slack group.

**As of 20/10/2023, this group has been suspended. The participants have continued with the reading group with a different focus, on algebras, categories and models.**

We have compiled some preliminary notes resulting from our meetings, and serving as a guide to the literature. You can find them [here](https://rodrigonalmeida.github.io/projects/Categorical_Model_Theory_Reading_Group/Accessible_Shelah_Eventual_Categoricity.pdf).
