**Description**
---------------

This reading group is focused on understanding the basics of stability theory and the fundamental concepts underpinning its study in the last 20 years. This is modelled after a course prepared by [Franziska Jahnke](https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/fjahn_01/en/), who has helped direct this reading group.

Our preliminary topic will start with topics covering the basics of contemporary model theory, namely Morley's categoricity theorem, and related topics:

1.  **Saturated Models, kappa-saturation, Monster Models**
2.  **Strong Minimality, Algebraic and definable closure, Independence, The Exhchange Principle**
3.  **Geometries and Pregeometries, Local modularity**
4.  **O-minimality, Semi-algebraic sets**
5.  **Omega-stability, Morley rank and degree, Algebraicity Conjecture, Indiscernibles**

### **Meeting Schedule**

We meet bi-weekly. Meetings are in person in SP904.
