tags: ["Supervised Project"]
excerpt: "This project is aimed at students with an interest in algebraic logic and duality theory, seeking to further their knowledge in the field and gain some research experience. This year the focus will be on a classical topic of research which is still quite active: amalgamation, and its interconnections with interpolation properties, as well as other related interpolation style properties (e.g. uniform interpolation)."

### **Description**

In the study of logical systems, there are several desirable properties which make the system more tractable: the finite model property, variants of the disjunction property, admissibility of rules, etc. Amongst these, interpolation is a quite attractive property, concerning a very natural problem: suppose one wants to check whether an entailment of A from B holds; can we do so by restricting the proof search to formulas containing only the symbols occurring in both? If we can, this can make the complexity of proofs, and of problems involving proof checking or model checking, dramatically lower. Nevertheless, unlike some of these other properties, interpolation is a rather rare and sparse property.

In this project we will study interpolation properties as well as their algebraic counterparts: amalgamation properties. We will also zoom in on related questions: some typically weaker properties, like definability type theorems (Beth properties), and some typically stronger properties, like uniform interpolation.
